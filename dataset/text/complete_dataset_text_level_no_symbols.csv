001-0,mhm . alright . there's a young boy that's getting a cookie jar . and he's in bad shape because the thing is falling over . and in the picture the mother is washing dishes and doesn't see it . and so the water is overflowing in the sink . and the dishes might fall over there if you don't get it . and it's a picture of a kitchen window . and the curtains are very distinct . but the water is still flowing .,dementia,ProbableAD
001-2,mhm . there's a young boy going in a cookie jar . and there's a young girl . and I'm saying he's a boy because it's hard to tell anymore . and he's in the cookie jar . and there's a stool that he is on and it already is starting to fall over . and so is the water in the sink is overflowing in the sink . I don't know about this hickey here whether that's more than what I said . like the mother is near the girl . and she has /. oh I can't think of the ... she has the she's trying to wipe dishes . oh and stop the water from going out .,dementia,ProbableAD
003-0,"here's a cookie jar . and the lid is off the cookie jar . the boy is about to come down on the floor . and the girl ... I don't know that much about girls . but anyway the housewife is in the kitchen . and the sink is overflowing . and the girl may be saying say hahaha I told you so or something like that . and I guess this must be the wife although it might not be because maybe that was an apron and maybe this was the ... this should be a window . there . the upper one is there . it has a pathway . we don't know where the pathway is going to because we can't see it down below . and looks like there's some flowers in the bushes or something like that . and here are some draperies . well this one on this side is . I don't see it , the other side , but I suspect it would be the same thing there . and I guess I said that the water was coming down on the floor . and I don't know the ... here are two cups for coffee or something like that . and ... and ...",dementia,ProbableAD
005-0,"the boy is slipping off the stool . he's trying to steal cookie . the mother is working at the sink with the water running over . the little girl is saying ""/. shh . the mother don't hear . did I say the sink was running over ? mother's drying the dishes .

007-1,. can I look at it and tell you ? oh okay . well there's a girl and a boy and the boy's in the cookie jar . and he's standing on a stool that's tipping over . and he's in the kitchen . and the mother's in the kitchen running the water at the sink . and the water's running over and it's all over the floor . and there are curtains at the windows . and there are cups and a plate on the pantry . and outside the window there's a path leading to a garage it looks like . and there are curtains there . and that's about all there .,dementia,ProbableAD
007-3,well the girl is telling the boy to get the cookies down but don't tell your mother . and the boy is also falling over off the stool . and the mother is letting the water run out_of the sink . and she's drying dishes . I don't quite get that but then ... she has water on the floor and basically it's kind_of a distressing scene . everything's going haywire . she needs to turn off the water . if she turned off the water she'd be a hundred percent better off .,dementia,ProbableAD
010-0,"oh boy . wowie the boy's going up on a stool to get cookies and he's falling off the stool and his sister is just wondering about it . will he hit the bottom ? mama has a sink that's overrunning with water splashing down onto her shoes . she's in the process of drying dishes . she's looking out an open window at the same time . the cookie jar is open . and the girl has her finger to her lips . well let me see . everything that's going to happen , huh ? looking out the window I don't know if it's the breeze blowing the curtains because over the window they look a little wee bit puffy . so maybe there's a slight breeze coming in the kitchen window . mama's drying the dishes and she forgetting herself and the water is overflowing from the sink down onto the floor splashing into her shoes . alright there are two cups and a plate on the counter to the right of the sink . and well I did tell you the boy is getting ready to fall off of the stool . his sister is reaching up for a cookie , getting it from the cookie jar . so what else ? the door is open of_course to get into the cupboard . doing . . three legged stool .

I told you the water was running over and splashing onto the floor . and the mother doesn't seem too too affected by it . she's drying a dish or wiping it . let's see . I guess the girl is laughing at her brother because he's going to fall . looks like a nice house . there is very little . but I don't think that's meant for this . the corner that got to the corner . so ‡ this is a corner here . and that goes back into there but that could be another . do you see what I'm making reference to ? the carpentry ?",dementia,ProbableAD

030-0,it's a picture of a kitchen . there's a child reaching on a cookie jar . a boy reaching into a cookie jar . he's falling . the stool is falling . a female youngster maybe sister is reaching up . and she's got a finger to her lip . the mother is at the sink washing a dish . the water is spilling over from the sink . the window is open looking out onto shrubbery and a path to another house . there are three dishes sitting on the sink counter . and there are a number of cabinets in the picture on the sink counter as it stretches around . and there's the cabinets above where the boy is reaching in . mother is washing a dish . she is dressed in a oh dress . and it appears she has an apron and a towel in her hand . as she's washing one of her feet is obviously in the water the other is somewhat obliterated . the children are completely outfitted . the girl with sandals of some kind and the boy it looks like maybe tennis shoes of a sort .,dementia,MCI
030-1,there are two children a boy and a girl . the girl is standing on the floor and the boy is reaching up into a cupboard that's open that has a cookie jar with the lid off of it . he has a cookie in his left hand . he's reaching for a second one and the stool on which he is standing has tipped over and he's going to fall down . the mother her back is to the event and she is washing dishes while her sink is overflowing with water onto the floor . she seems to be oblivious of it . the window is opened looking out onto a pathway that has a tree and shrubbery and a part of what might be an extension of the house or a garage . and there are curtains over the window . and there are two cups and a saucer that she is either going to wash or has already washed . and this event is taking place in the kitchen . I don't know if I said that or not . and I believe that's about all that I can see .,dementia,MCI
033-0,okay . apparently a mother and a daughter and a son are in the kitchen . and the son is standing on the stool which is tilting . and he has his hand in the cookie jar and handing one cookie to his sister . at the same time the mother is doing dishes and apparently looking out the window because she has allowed the sink to run over and it's cascading onto the floor and her feet . she has dried a few dishes two cups and a plate and is attempting to dry another plate now . and she's looking out into the yard which I could see the driveway and maybe the end of the house or the garage with a_lot_of shrubbery around it .,dementia,MCI
033-1,the boy's going into the cookie jar . and the mother is standing over here . cookie jar . the guy's going into the cookie jar . mother's doing the dishes or just putting it on the table .

033-3,okay a child falling off a stool in the attempt to reach the cookie jar which it looks like he's knocked the lid off . and maybe he's gonna drop the cookie . and his girlfriend is standing there beckoning him or reaching for the cookie that he's sposta give her . and the mother is not paying any attention to the kids . she's looking out the window and drying the dishes . at the same time she has let the sink run over and the water is cascading down on the floor and onto her feet . the curtains are waving and the window is open . and the yard looks like it's manicured . and other than the stool and the cabinets and the dishes that's all I can see .,dementia,MCI
033-4,okay . there are three persons in the kitchen . the little girl is instructing the little boy to take cookies out_of the cookie jar on the second shelf of the cupboard . and at the same time his stool that he's standing on is about to collapse . the mother apparently is doing dishes and looking out the window . has the faucet on in the sink . and apparently the plug is in and the water is cascading over the kitchen floor . and it must be a warm sunny day because the window is open . and I can see the shrubbery and what appears to be the end of the house maybe a garage door . and on the counter there are dishes that the mother has either washed or has dried and is still washing a plate .,dementia,MCI
035-0,oh . oh great . oh the boy is taking cookies . and he's also going to fall off his stepstool .

065-2,alright let's start over here . the little boy is standing on a stool which is about to fall over . and he is getting a cookie out_of the cookie jar . and his little sister comes //. the lid's off . and he has a cookie in his hand . and his little sister is down here . and she has her hand up to take the a cookie out_of the little boy's hand . he's giving it to her . and her mother is standing at the sink wiping a dish with a tea towel . and then there's a sink that has faucets . and the water is on . and she's is spilling over onto the floor . and on the sink also there are two cups and a plate . and above the sink is a window . and you look out and you see the garage and a drive into which has bushes on the side . and in the garage there's also a window . and then up the curtains . and you can see the top of the garage out the window . and her curtains curtains on her window . and the cupboards are underneath the sink . and it's a good job there if you ask .,dementia,MCI
066-0,well the boy's on the stool . and the stool's tipped over . and it's not a ladder it's a stepstool . and she's . from what I can see he's going to upset the cookies . and the sink is flowing over on the floor while the mother I guess is drying the dishes . boy ‡ I'll tell you I wouldn't wanna be on that stepstool there . it's not even a stepstool . it's just a stool . the water's overflowing on the floor . there's probably some more water back this way but I'm not too sure at all except that the water's pouring down . I'm trying to figure out what this is out here .,dementia,ProbableAD
067-1,"that's it . well the girl's drying the plate . and she's overflowing the water in the sink . there's a boy up on a stool and he's falling off of it . trying to get a cake or something . in the cupboard . see he's trying to get this and he's gonna fall off of there . so ... and the mother's water's all coming down out_of her sink there . the little girl is putting her hand up to the boy . they're gonna get something out_of that jar , a pineapple jar or something .",dementia,ProbableAD
067-2,the little boy is up on this thing here . and he's up trying to get something out_of the garden selection „ I think it is . the little girl I think is mad because she didn't get some of it . and here's mama drying the dishes . no ‡ just the little girl and the boy was on here . the little girl and the boy . she's reaching up to the boy . and the boy got his other hand down . so ‡ it looks color /. no ‡ that's all . oh ‡ she spilled something „ I think . from the sink down . it came splashing down . that's the first I noticed it .

I can't believe she's upset about the kids because she hasn't seen them . maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes . in other words it's ... she's deciding that if she did see them she's deciding that she's going to let them go ahead with it . but I don't think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling . I think she would have turned . maybe dropped her dish . but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall . and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too . and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad /. threesome and the kitchen would be a mess .,dementia,ProbableAD
076-2,oh my . you mean how much or just the ones ? oh . the sink is overflowing while she's wiping a plate and not looking . the little boy is hungry . he wants to get some cookies . and he's standing on a stool . and it's tipping over . and I don't know whether he's gonna bring the cookie jar with him or what . and the little girl is holding up her hand wanting some . and he's gonna give to him . but I don't know if she has a finger to her mouth but ... and she knows that he's gonna be tipping over it looks like to me . or maybe she's just not noticing it and making her mouth get ready for this good cookie . I don't know which way it is for the little girl . because she's smiling . I think if she saw him falling over she'd do something to help him so he wouldn't get hurt . I_mean she'd grab it or something . but she's just looking up at him you_know looking up at those good cookies and waiting for them to come to her hand . but this little finger in her mouth is ... I'm not quite sure what it means . I think it means that it's gonna be good . yeah . and I don't know whether the mother knows this is wet yet . she's thinking something else I think . I don't know what it is . what are we going to have for lunch ? or she's got something in her mind because certainly she'd see this if she didn't hear it .,dementia,ProbableAD
